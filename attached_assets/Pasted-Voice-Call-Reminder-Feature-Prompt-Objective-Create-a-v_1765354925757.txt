Voice Call Reminder Feature Prompt

---

**Objective:**
Create a voice call reminder system that allows scheduling and sending automated reminder calls to users.

---

**Requirements:**

1. **Communication Method:**

   * The system must support **Voice Call** as a communication method for reminders.

2. **Input Data:**

   * Recipient phone number (in international format)
   * Reminder message content (text that will be converted to speech)
   * Scheduled date and time for the call
   * User’s time zone (to send the call at the correct local time)
   * Caller ID (phone number that appears as the caller)

3. **Call Content:**

   * Use **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to read out the reminder message.
   * Support pre-recorded audio files optionally.

4. **Scheduling:**

   * Calls can be scheduled for a future date and time, considering the user’s local time zone.
   * If the scheduled time is in the past, send the call immediately.

5. **Call Execution:**

   * At the scheduled time, initiate a voice call to the recipient’s phone number.
   * Play the reminder message via TTS or pre-recorded audio.
   * Optionally support user interaction (e.g., press 1 to confirm).

6. **Status Tracking and Notifications:**

   * Track call status: queued, ringing, in-progress, completed, failed, no-answer, busy.
   * Provide real-time updates via webhooks or callbacks.
   * Log call history with timestamps and statuses.

7. **Error Handling:**

   * Retry logic for failed or no-answer calls.
   * Notify admins or users of persistent failures.

**Additional Notes:**

* Ensure compliance with telecom regulations and user consent for calls.
* Optimize call timing to avoid disturbing users (e.g., no calls late at night).
* Allow easy customization of reminder message templates.
