You are an expert in analyzing Flutter (Dart) applications.

Your task is to scan ALL provided Flutter project files and extract EVERY SINGLE API CALL made by the app — nothing must be missed.

You must detect all network calls made using:
- http package (`http.get`, `http.post`, `http.put`, `http.patch`, `http.delete`, etc.)
- Dio package (`dio.get`, `dio.post`, etc.)
- Chopper
- Retrofit for Dart
- GraphQL clients
- WebSocket connections
- Custom network wrappers/services
- Any dynamic or string-built URLs
- Any platform channel that triggers API calls
- Any repository/service/provider file making API requests

For EVERY detected API request, extract:

1. HTTP Method  
2. Full URL or BaseURL + Path  
3. Headers used (Authorization, Content-Type, custom headers, etc.)  
4. Query parameters  
5. URL parameters  
6. Request Body / Payload  
7. Response Format (JSON, map, list, string, status codes)  
8. Status Codes handled  
9. Error handling logic (try/catch, onError, interceptors)  
10. Authentication method (JWT, Bearer token, API Key, OAuth, Firebase, etc.)  
11. File where it is used  
12. Class and function where the API is called  
13. Middleware / Interceptors (Dio interceptors, retry logic, logging)  
14. Caching layers (Hive, SharedPreferences, local storage)  
15. Any comments describing the API  
16. Whether the API call is direct or through a wrapper service  
17. Any missing, ambiguous, or unknown data (mark as UNKNOWN)

OUTPUT MUST INCLUDE:

A) A MASTER TABLE containing:
- Method  
- URL  
- Headers  
- Params  
- Query  
- Body  
- Response  
- Status Codes  
- Auth  
- File  
- Function  

B) A COMPLETE JSON object containing all extracted API call metadata.

C) Generate a final file named:
   **flutter_api_calls_documentation.md**
   containing:
   - Project name (from pubspec.yaml)  
   - Total number of API calls  
   - The master table  
   - The JSON documentation  
   - Notes on uncertainties  

RULES:
- Trace all classes: Services, Providers, Cubits, Blocs, Controllers, Utils, Helpers.  
- Resolve Base URLs from environment config (`.env`, constants, config files).  
- Detect dynamic URL building (string interpolation, variables).  
- Include APIs even if commented or deprecated (mark as DEPRECATED).  
- DO NOT MISS ANY API CALL under any circumstance.

After reading this, confirm understanding and ask me to upload the Flutter project files for analysis.
